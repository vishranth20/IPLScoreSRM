# IPL Score Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket scores based on historical data. The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the total score of a cricket team based on various features such as venue, batting team, bowling team, batsmen, and bowlers.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have used a dataset ([ipl_data.csv](ipl_data.csv)) containing various features related to IPL matches, including:

- Venue
- Batting Team
- Bowling Team
- Batsmen
- Bowlers
- Runs scored
- Wickets taken
- Overs played
- Runs and wickets in the last 5 overs

The main steps involved in this project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
   - Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
   - Scaling numerical features using MinMaxScaler.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Utilizing Keras (with TensorFlow backend) to build a neural network model.
   - Experimenting with different architectures (number of layers, units per layer) to optimize performance.
   - Training the model using historical IPL data.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
   - Iteratively refining the model to achieve better predictive accuracy.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Implementing prediction functionality using the trained model.
   - Creating an interactive prediction interface using `ipywidgets` for selecting venue, batting team, bowling team, batsman, and bowler.

5. **Comparison with Other Models**:
   - Implementing Gradient Boosting Regressor and Support Vector Regressor from scikit-learn for benchmarking and comparing performance.

## Results

After experimenting with various neural network architectures and model configurations, the final model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 11.95
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 344.24
- R-squared (R2) Score: 0.592

These metrics indicate that the model is able to predict IPL scores with a high degree of accuracy, explaining approximately 59.2% of the variance in the data.
